An Asciidoctor clone in Go. Very early stages.

Code style
----------
- Don't break the tests

- Format with gofmt

- Use Ginkgo for tests

- Comment every new function or struct you add

- Never use `panic` in reachable code

- Use `snake_case` for filenames, camel case for symbols

- Run the tests before (and after) you commit
